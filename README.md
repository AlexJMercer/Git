# Instagram Auto-Liker 

#### This python program will help you automatically like Instagram posts, all you need is to input number of posts.

## Features:
- Version 2 of the bot identifies the like button, and automatically moves cursor to that position.
- Uses PyAutoGUI
- Has feature to try finding like button again in case the instagram post loads in a bit late.

## Disadvantages:
- Cannot run in background
- ONLY works for slideshow posts (meaning, posts that come one after the other, for example, on someone's profile.)
- CAN fail sometimes, however, chances of error at current stage is low.
